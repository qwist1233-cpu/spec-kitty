"""The single gate-selection authority (FR-016 / #2476) — consistency, singularity, floor.

``scripts/ci/gate_selection.py`` is the ONE importable authority that answers
"which shards/gates does a diff select". These guards prove:

* **Consistency** — its answers agree with the two hand-authored routing sources
  (the dorny filter block + the job ``if:`` gates) for representative diffs.
* **Singularity / parses-not-re-encodes** — it reads the *real on-disk* router
  YAML; mutating a temp copy of that YAML changes its answer, proving it PARSES
  rather than carrying a second hand-maintained routing map (the #2476 hazard).
  WP17 (completeness oracle) and WP18 (local pre-PR parity) import this same
  module — there is no second parser.
* **Fail-closed (FR-004 / T039)** — an unmapped ``src/**`` change forces run-all;
  ``docs``/``corpus`` are non-src and excluded from the unmatched loop.
* **Non-vacuity floor** — the parsed model is not empty.
