"""Single gate-selection authority (FR-016 / #2476).

This module is the one authority for "which shards/gates does a changed-path set
select". It **parses** the two hand-authored routing authorities straight out of
the on-disk ``.github/workflows/ci-router.yml``:

1. the dorny ``changes`` filter block — ``group -> globs[]`` (path -> group), and
2. the job ``if: needs.changes.outputs.<group>`` gates — group -> job.

It never re-encodes the routing as a second hand-maintained map: that duplication
is the very #2476 hazard this module exists to close. It is reused by CI routing,
the WP17 completeness oracle, and WP18 local pre-PR parity — one parser, one
answer, no drift.

Public API:
    ``load_router(path=None) -> Router``   parse the two authorities.
    ``select_gates(changed_paths, *, router=None, mode="pr") -> GateSelection``
                                            answer the selection question.
